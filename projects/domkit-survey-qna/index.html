				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>DOMKit is an open-source, client-side, JS library used to simplify the creation of HTML elements and CSS styling options. It's still work-in-progress, but still provides multiple web design functions to make ui design easier.</p>
                <p>I'm quite far into development with this new library, but I need some testers to provide feedback for DOMKit, to fully prepare it for launch.</p>
				<p>I decided to create a testing survey for people with web dev experience to explore DOMKit and give valuable feedback to make it better. This QnA will also be linked in the survey, allowing people to read this article before submitting their responses, so they fully understand what they're getting into.</p>
				<p>In this article, I answer some common questions about the survey.</p>
            </div>
			<hr style="color: white; width: 100%;">
			<div class="desc">
				<h2>What is the Purpose of the Survey?</h2>
				<p>The purpose is to gather feedback from website developers regarding this open-sourced, vanilla JS library, and understand, based on feedback and experimentation, how effortlessly it is to use this library in your own websites, as well as improvements to be made to make the library even better.</p>
				<p>As well as this, I'd love for developers to use this library in their own work, so for this to happen, qualified web developers will need to test and provide feedback on DOMKit and its functionality before it's properly launched.</p>
			</div>
            <div class="desc">
				<h2>Who is Qualified to Complete the Survey?</h2>
                <p>If you have some web development experience, whether academic or work, this is a great opportunity for you! It will also allow me to gain useful insight into the industry standard of working with JS libraries.</p>
                <p>If you have friends or family that have web development experience, be sure to reach out to them about this opportunity!</p>
            </div>
			<div class="desc">
				<h2>How Many People Would You Like For the Survey?</h2>
                <p>Preferably, I would like at least 20 developers for this survey, but the more the merrier.</p>
			</div>
            <div class="desc">
				<h2>What Sort of Question Will be Asked?</h2>
                <p>The questions will be a mixture of experimentation, multiple-choice and written responses.</p>
                <p>The experimentation focuses more on testing code and seeing how well it works without errors and functionality-wise, mostly on getting started with DOMKit and using it in a HTML script.</p>
                <p>The multiple choice questions focus on testing if the code works correctly and without any bugs/errors. They're also used at the vert start to ask general questions about your web development knowledge.</p>
				<p>The written responses are mostly focused on additional functionality for the library, what buge/errors have occurred if the scripts do not work for you, like/dislike about DOMKit, etc.</p>
			</div>
            <div class="desc">
				<h2>Where will the Link For It Be?</h2>
                <p>I'll be posting the link on every single one of my socials to branch out to as many web developers as possible, including Instagram, Ko-Fi and Discord.</p>
                <p>On this website, the link will be posted under the 'DOMKit' project, and also avaliable in the DOMKit documentation.</p>
			</div>
			<hr style="color: white; width: 100%;">
			<div class="desc">
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>These were some common questions about the DOMKit library! If you have any more questions about it, or need any further clarification with any of these FAQs, be sure to send me an email!</p>
				<p>Thank you very much for reading, and I hope to see you at the survey!</p>
