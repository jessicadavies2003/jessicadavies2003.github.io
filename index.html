				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>My name is <b>Jessica Davies</b>, and I'm a postgraduate from Cardiff University, with the following achievement:</p>
				<p><b>Bachelor of Sciences (Hons. Computer Science)</b></p>
				<p>My passion mainly revolves around <b>web development</b> and <b>UI and UX design</b>, but I have a few other things I like to do in my free time, such as <b>artwork</b>.</p>

				<h2>My Skills</h2>
				<p><b>Advanced</b> - Python, HTML, CSS</p>

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>In 2019, I enrolled into Crosskeys college, located in Newport Gwent, for a total of 2 years. Here, I studied three subjects: <b>Computer Science, Maths, and French</b>. I chose Computer Science and Maths, as programming was (and still is) my passion, and I chose French, as many of my lecturers told me that my French pronounciation is very good, and I wanted to learn a language during my study.</p>
				<p>In 2021, I then enrolled into Cardiff University, as I was presented a conditional offer and met their requirements. I studied Computer Science in this university for a total of 3 years.</p>
				<p>In May 2025, I will begin my studies at Coventry University, studying Software Development at a masters level. The duration of the course is 2 years, meaning that it will be a part time course. During this time, I wish to gain some work experience by applying for a part time job in Coventry.</p>
